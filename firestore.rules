/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Pixel Emporium.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (addresses, orders, cart items), while allowing public read access to products
 * and categories. Reviews are publicly accessible but creating them is restricted
 * to authenticated users, and ownership is enforced for updates and deletes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Public product information.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Public category information.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information (private).
 * - /users/{userId}/addresses/{addressId}: User's addresses (private).
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: User's orders (private).
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: User's order items (private).
 * - /users/{userId}/cartItems/{cartItemId}: User's cart items (private).
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Product reviews (public read, owner write).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Products and Categories are publicly readable.
 * - User data is strictly private, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - Reviews are publicly readable, but creating, updating and deleting them
 *   is restricted to the review's author.
 * - User listing is explicitly denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reviews include the userId to allow direct ownership checks without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public data (products, categories) and private data (user profiles, orders)
 *   are stored in separate top-level collections to simplify rules and avoid
 *   complex queries.
